Monica is a sentiment analysis project that leverages TensorFlow for machine learning tasks and Gradio for creating a customizable UI. This project aims to analyze text and determine the sentiment behind it, providing insights into the user's feelings.
(More features coming soon!!)

 Features 🌈

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Monica uses a pre-trained model to analyze text and determine the sentiment behind it. It can classify text as happy or sad.
- **Customizable UI**: Gradio is used to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the sentiment analysis model.
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access and sharing.

# Important Notes 📝

If you are creating the `sentiment_model` from scratch, it's better to delete the existing `sentiment_model` folder. The `sentiment_model` folder is the most crucial folder required to run the project. If the application fails, re-run `sentiment.py`.
Its recommended to rerun `sentiment.py` and delete the older `sentiment_model` folder that comes during cloning of the repo
